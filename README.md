# Garageline

Full-stack garage progress tracker - built with React with a Node/Express back-end.

## Description

Garageline is a progress tracker for garages. It allows customers to visit a customer portal, enter their vehicle registration and find out information about the status and progress on their vehicle.

This allows the client to see things such as:

- Status of work (waiting, in the workshop, completed, etc)
- Assigned technician (for example, "John is working on your vehicle")
- Unforeseen issues (such as "We noticed your brake pads need replacing")

I plan on adding features such as:

- Push notifications on completion/update

## Motivation

This application is designed to prevent using human hours to give customers updates on their vehicle, and to automate some of the process.

## Stack

Front-end:

- React
- Sass (BEM)

Back-end:

- Node
- Express
- MongoDB

# Vehicle Workshop Progress Tracker

A full-stack vehicle workshop progress tracker.

## Description

A full-stack vehicle workshop progress tracker that enables customers to access a portal where they can enter their vehicle registration and get instant information about the status and progress of the work being carried out on their vehicle.

The client can see things such as:

- The status of the work being carried out (waiting, in the workshop, completed, etc).
- The assigned technician (for example, "John is working on your vehicle.").
- Any unforeseen issues (such as "The technician has recommended that your front brake pads need replacing.").

Additional features will include things such as:

- Push notifications when there is up an update or when the car is ready for collection.
